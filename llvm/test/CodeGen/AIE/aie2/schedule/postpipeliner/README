The tests in these directory are single loops that need to be post-pipelined.
They supply the input to the scheduler and test the generated assembly code. 
It is likely that the detailed schedule changes over time, and this can be
automatically updated provided that neither the II nor the stage count grows.
If the stage count grows, automatic update is allowed if the II shrinks.
The II is the number of lines between the loop block's label upto and including
the cycle headed by the loop end label.
The stage count is determined by the immediate operand of setting the
lc register.

Note that the LLVM IR doesn't match the actual MIR code. It is just a standard
loop providing some pointers into different spaces to dereference.
